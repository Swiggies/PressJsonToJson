# Installation
Unzip the folder into your Halo Online (Or whatever you renamed it to, the one with Eldorado.exe).

# How To Use
Make sure your maps and variants folders have the game modes you want to use (comes with some default variants and all default maps) otherwise you won't be able to select any.

Select the maps you want your server to use in the top left list and select game variants in the top right.
When you select a game variant another window will show. You can select specific maps for that variant to use with this and input commands to be run when your server loads that variant.

If you want your variant to only run with a specific map, don't select the map in the main window otherwise that map will be run with other variants.

# Planned Features
Add support for veto.json
